\section{Introduction}

Chaos manifests in life, at times in natural calamities. In emergency situations as such when members of the family are disperesed, communication is difficult to establish. 

``Guardians" is a prototype application intended to establish simple yet efficient communication within close cricles such as a family, during humanitarian emergencies. The key to the design is efficiency with simplicity. Unlike other social networking platforms, ``Guardians" has a single focus of informing the whereabouts and the status of the loved ones to one another.
