If you want the word count included in the LaTeX document, the easiest way is to write the output from TeXcount to a file and include this. If you run 
  texcount.pl -1 -sum document.tex > document.sum 
with the desired file names, this will produce a file containing only the total word count; alternatively, 
  texcount.pl -1 -sum document.tex -out=document.sum 
will cause TeXcount to write the result directly to the file. Then define the LaTeX macro \wordcount 
  \newcommand\wordcount{\input{document.sum}} 
to include the count, or 
  \newcommand\wordcount{\input{\jobname.sum}} 
to use the name of the main LaTeX document instead of document as file name. Alternatively, you may produce more extensive output using 
  texcount.pl document.tex -out=document.sum 
and, with \usepackage{verbatim}, define 
  \newcommand\wordcount{\verbatiminput{\jobname.sum}} 
to include the full summary. Of course, if you have several files you want included, use the -inc option.
